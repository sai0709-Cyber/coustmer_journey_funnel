 Customer Journey Funnel Optimization

 Objective
Analyze customer campaign data to uncover drop-off points across the marketing funnel and recommend data-driven strategies to improve conversion rates.

 Dataset
- Source: UCI Bank Marketing Dataset (`bank-additional-ready.csv`)
- Features include demographics (age, job, education), call history (duration, previous outcome), and economic indicators.

 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Power BI for interactive dashboarding

 Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing in Python**
   - Cleaned and split dataset into training, validation, and test sets
   - Handled class imbalance with oversampling using `RandomOverSampler`
   - Applied feature scaling using `StandardScaler`

2. **Modeling & Evaluation**
   - Trained a KNN classifier to predict subscription likelihood
   - Evaluated precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes
   - Verified performance using a classification report and confusion matrix

3. **Funnel Analysis & Visualization**
   - Simulated funnel stages: Contacted → Previously Contacted → Converted
   - Identified ~87% drop-off from initial outreach to final conversion
   - Exported conversion data for Power BI visualization

4. **Segment Analysis**
   - Analyzed conversion rates by job category using Python
   - Found significant variation across segments (e.g., Job 8 had 32% conversion)
   - Highlighted underperforming roles for campaign strategy refinement

5. **Power BI Integration**
   - Built interactive funnel and demographic dashboards
   - Used slicers to explore conversion behavior by job, age, and education
   - Delivered actionable visual insights for outreach optimization

 Outcome
Exposed high-impact drop-off stages and revealed job-based conversion trends. Provided data-backed recommendations to target responsive customer segments and improve overall campaign ROI.
